# Discrete-tomography

University algorithmic project. The goal of this project is to recreate an 2D image through ligne and column data of the image. Every line/column has a sequence of numbers representing a sequence of black squares. The main goal was to developed and optimise an algorithm who analyse these sequences and find (if it's possible) a way of placing every sequence correctly and represent the image.
